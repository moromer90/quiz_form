test job for devteam

to see how it works, clone my repo and start an http-server in local directory

In the given code I didn't use any special poll frameworks as Survey.js or decoration libraries as: Animate.css, Pretty_checkbox.css, Lettering.j or similar staff, so that you could see that I can work either with pure JavaScript & jQuery, manage with basic CSS or ready-made libraries.

Page grid built with Bootstrap3. If necessary I can recode it to Flexbox usage.
